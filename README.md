## 👥  Responsibilities

mohammad muntaser : Focused on **Data Preprocessing**. Responsible for the `EDA.ipynb` notebook, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for modeling, Focused on **Regression Analysis**. Developed and tested models found in `RegressionModels.ipynb`, Focused on **Classification Tasks**. implemented the models in `classificationModels.ipynb` and analyzed the results,featureEngineering.ipynb,Shap&robustness.ipynb,AutoML.ipynb,CasualAnalysis.ipnyb so basicly everything.



I used these libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
shap
h2o
matplotlim
seaborn
statsmodel
streamlit
plotly

and here is a quick summary of the project:
Executive Summary
This project aims to predict whether an Instacart user will reorder a specific product in their next order. Using a dataset of over 3 million orders, we developed a robust Machine Learning pipeline that handles "Big Data" challenges through memory optimization. We engineered behavioral features and benchmarked seven different algorithms, ranging from linear baselines to automated ensembles. The final XGBoost model achieved an AUC of 0.834, offering the best balance of accuracy, speed, and interpretability. We further validated this model using SHAP explainability, robustness stress-testing, and causal inference analysis.
